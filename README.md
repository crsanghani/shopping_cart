# shopping_cart

Develop a functional shopping cart e-commerce site with as much of the below functionality as possible in the available time.it is not necessary for the solution to process payments.

## Functionality

- Product list and details should be retrieved via api to get them from a database
- It should be possible to both rate products and add comments about the products
- Comments should be restricted to a maximum of 350 characters
- View multiple products and add them to the shopping cart
- Add remove items from the shopping cart and change the quantity of items in the shopping cart
- The shopping cart should display and calculate individual item prices and a total price of the items in the cart. The state of the shopping cart should also keep its state if the browser is closed and reopened

## Learning focus

- Understand state and props better, I feel like I made some poor choices about the structure differences between CartList and the Products.
- Look at other code examples of carts to see how I could have planned the build better (started by using the state functions rather that adding them afterwards)
- Re-read the faker documentation for tweaks to the product generation (more suitable pictures, not a huge problem with dummy data but still something that should be addressed)

## Actions
I should have planned out the components first
- I used this to re-learn about states and props, a great description using star wars https://medium.freecodecamp.com/react-props-state-explained-through-darth-vaders-hunt-for-the-rebels-8ee486576492#.80nk4lij0
